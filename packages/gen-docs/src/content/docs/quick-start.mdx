## Note Format

Every note in Gen follows this pattern:

```
[octave][note][accidental][rhythm]
```

| Part | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| Octave | `^` (up), `_` (down) | `^C` = C one octave up |
| Note | A-G or `$` for rest | `C`, `D`, `E`, `$` |
| Accidental | `#` (sharp), `b` (flat) | `F#`, `Bb` |
| Rhythm | Duration modifier | `/` = eighth, `p` = half |

## Examples

```
C           # Quarter note C
E/          # Eighth note E
Gp          # Half note G
_Ab/        # Ab eighth note, one octave down
^F#//       # F# sixteenth note, one octave up
$           # Quarter rest
$/          # Eighth rest
Gp*         # Dotted half note G
```

## Rhythm Modifiers

| Modifier | Duration |
|----------|----------|
| (none) | Quarter note |
| `/` | Eighth note |
| `//` | Sixteenth note |
| `///` | 32nd note |
| `p` | Half note |
| `o` | Whole note |
| `*` | Dotted (add after rhythm) |

## Document Structure

Every Gen file has optional metadata at the top, followed by measures (one per line):
